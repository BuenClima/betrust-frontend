# Request for Change

* **Start Date:** (YYYY-MM-DD)
* **RFC PR:** (closes #some-pull-request)


## Summary

<!-- Give a brief explanation of the changed rule -->

## Basic example

<!--

Give an example in code where this rule would pass and fail.
This should match the pattern found in readme.md

-->

## Motivation

<!--

Why are we doing this?
What use cases does it support?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

-->

## Drawbacks

<!--

Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:

- The impact on current and previous codebases
- implementation cost: code readability and safety
- the impact on teaching others
- cost of migrating existing Elanco modules

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Please attempt to identify them here.

-->

## Unresolved questions

<!-- Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD? -->
